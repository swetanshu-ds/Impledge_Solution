Word Composition Problem ReadMe
Overview:
The Word Composition Problem is a Python program designed to efficiently identify the longest and second-longest compound words from a given list of words. It utilizes dynamic programming for quick analysis, making it suitable for large input files.


Execution Steps:
1. Open the shared github repository named as Impledge_Solution.
2. Download it into your local system and extract it and then open it using any code editor( VS Code).
3. Run the python file named as :- Solution_file.ipynb
4. In the code line: findAllConcatenatedWordsInADict("Input_02.txt"), you can change the code to findAllConcatenatedWordsInADict("Input_01.txt"), to get output of other file.


Design Decisions:
1. Data Structures: Utilizes sets and lists for efficient word storage and manipulation.
2. Algorithm: Employs dynamic programming for determining compound words, ensuring performance.
3. Efficiency: Prioritizes performance by minimizing time complexity through appropriate data structures and algorithms.


Approach:
1. Input Processing: Read input file into a list of words.
2. Compound Word Identification: Use dynamic programming to identify compound words.
3. Sorting: Sort identified compound words by length for easy retrieval.
4. Output: Display longest and second-longest compound words along with processing time.


Conclusion:
The Word Composition offers a robust solution for identifying compound words efficiently, suitable for various applications requiring compound word analysis.
